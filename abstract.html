				<h3><a name=UIIC><a href="41_UIIC.pdf">Influenza Immunization Campaigns: Is an Ounce of Prevention Worth a Pound of Cure?</a></a>
				<br/>(June 2011 - revise and resubmit)</h3>
				
				<br/>
				<p>A standard argument for public health care would claim efficiency gains from disease prevention. However, even where preventative technologies are more efficient, private action may fail to exhaust all external net-benefits of prevention. Furthermore, health officials may base policies on evidence failing to take such externalities into account. To assess these issues, this paper studies a novel influenza-immunization program expanding vaccination coverage outside the standard "target-group." By using exogenous variation in vaccine quality and variation in program adoption across sub-regions in Canada, I causally link higher vaccination rates to significant health improvements. Results are threefold: (i) coverage-expansion leads to large relative gains for program-regions; (ii) benefits exhibit decreasing returns corresponding to predictions of a standard model of disease dynamics; and (iii) substantial external benefits accrue to older adults.

				<h3><a name=SEIL><a href="43_SEILS.pdf">The long-term economic effects of school immunization mandates: does prenatal exposure to state school immunization policy impact health and well-being in later life?</a></a>
				<br/> (July 2011)</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>State school immunization mandates of the late 1960s and 1970s had a substantial and immediate impact on measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) incidence. While these mandates were targeted at the school age population, evidence presented implies significant benefits for children in-utero. Specifically, this paper shows that individuals whose prenatal period occurred after mandate adoption had much to gain from such policies. Using variability in the timing of immunization mandates across states and comparing individuals with prenatal periods before and after immunization laws were enacted, I show that adoption of school mandates had an immediate effect on birth weight and a long-term effect on adult health. This is after controlling for individual characteristics, state specific characteristics and flexible functions of the date of conception. Moreover, results are strongest for individuals whose gestational period covers the seasonal epidemic period for MMR, implying that seasonal differences in birth outcomes become more minor in the post law period. Evidence of the contemporaneous and long term-effect of prenatal exposure to entry laws suggests that external benefits from mandatory immunization policies are much broader than accounted for in previous literature.

				<h3><a name=pollution><a href="42_AirPollution.pdf">Air pollution and health: the effect of outdoor air quality on respiratory health</a></a>
				<br/> (May 2010)</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>Recent changes in standards for air pollution are highly contentious and represent stringent constraints on economic activity. This paper presents evidence that directly informs this debate. By linking daily air pollution levels to hospital admissions for municipalities across Ontario, I study the impact of air pollution at levels below those historically considered. Results indicate that particulate matter (PM) has a significant effect on respiratory health of children but that ozone and carbon monoxide have little effect on respiratory hospitalizations for all age groups. I estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the average five-day levels of fine PM leads to a 2.7 percent increase in respiratory admissions of children under the age of 6 and a 4.4 percent increase in the respiratory admissions of children 6 to 19 years. Considering the decreases in fine PM that have occurred over the 2000-2006 period, these estimates imply a decrease of 1,805 child hospitalizations and an approximate savings of $16 million.

				<h3><a name=car><a href="">Traffic collisions and social pricing of automobile insurance</a></a>
				<br/> (September 2008)</h3>
<br/>
				
				<p>This paper analyses the relationship between motor vehicle collisions and social pricing within a public automobile insurance regime. Since social pricing does not adjust insurance premiums for social factors such as age, gender or marital status, it has implications for the risk distribution of insured drivers and consequences for the overall collision rate. Using the institution of social pricing in public automobile insurance in two Canadian provinces, this paper finds that total collisions are 22.2% higher under public insurance. It also finds that the institution of public insurance changes the number of actuarially riskier drivers insuring vehicles; specifically, younger or elderly drivers. For instance, drivers that are less than 25 years of age insure 4.6% more cars under social pricing relative to those aged 35 to 44. This result suggests a demand elasticity for those less than 25 of approximately 0.27.

				<h3><a name=fluca>Influenza, the in-utero environment, and later developmental outcomes in children (with Shelley Phipps)</a>
				<br/>(in Progress)</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>Previous research has shown support for the fetal origins hypothesis by demonstrating that exposure to influenza in the prenatal period has implications for later adult economic success (Almond 2006; Almond and Muzumder 2005). While the historical link between shocks to the prenatal environment and adult outcomes is clear, much less is known about how these shocks affect skill accumulation throughout early childhood. Moreover, evidence on the timing of the latent effects of prenatal shocks is essential to our understanding of this relationship, particularly in view of recent literature suggesting that gaps in early developmental status can widen over time, and that the optimum time for investment in child well being could be at the earliest, even before birth (Almond and Currie 2011a-b; Cunha and Heckman 2010; Cunha, Heckman and Schennach 2010; Case and Paxson 2010a-b). Combining recent data on influenza prevalence with the information on childhood development collected in the NLSCY, we provide evidence on three primary questions: whether prenatal influenza exposure impacts early childhood development, what types of early developmental factors are most affected, and the extent to which this relationship can be captured by standard measures of health at birth such as birth weight.

				<h3><a name=fluus>The Seasonal Flu Virus and Infant Health Outcomes (with Heather Royer)</a>
				<br/>(in Progress)</h3>
				<br/>
				
				<p>A growing literature within economics suggests that the in utero environment can have important consequences for short and long-run outcomes. Of the possible shocks to the in utero environment, influenza has particularly strong effects. But this evidence is based on historical flu epidemics (Almond  2006; Kelly 2009) in the first half of the 20th century. Much less is known about the effect of influenza on birth outcomes today despite the public policies encouraging mothers to obtain the influenza vaccine. An empirical examination of the flu, moreover, may give further insight to the causes of seasonal patterns in birth and long-run outcomes (Buckles and Hungerman 2009). While some of these seasonal fluctuations may be due to selection, the seasonal patterns still persist even after accounting for fixed maternal background characteristics. To study the impact of the flu on infant health outcomes, we combine natality data with measures of local flu virus activity acquired from mortality data, the Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILI), and Google Trends. We use two methods for identifying these effects: exploiting county-level variation over time in influenza rates and exploiting variation in vaccine quality.

				<h3><a name=delist>The Effects of De-listing Publicly Funded Health Care Services (with Mark Stabile)</a></h3> 
				<p>in Health Services Restructuring in Canada: New Evidence and New Directions, John Deutsch Institute for the Study of Economic Policy, Beach, et al, (eds.), McGill/Queens University Press, Kingston, pp.83-110.
				</p>
				<br/>
				
				<p>This paper uses variation created by the de-listing of insured services across Canadian provinces over the 1990s to estimate both the demand response across services, and whether this demand response varies by sub-groups such as low-income and elderly individuals. Our findings suggest that while the de-listing of services did affect utilization, the effect was not uniform across services, nor across populations. For example, while the demand for physiotherapy and eye exams decreased, the demand for speech therapy services, and chiropractic services increased in some cases. Nor did people adjust along all margins. While the number of people using any physiotherapy services decreased, the number of visits among those who did use physiotherapy services increased. We do not find large difference for low-income individuals with the exception of optometry services, nor do we find large differences between the elderly and the general population with the exception of physiotherapy.
