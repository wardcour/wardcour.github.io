<h2><b>Research Overview</b></h2>

<h4>I am an applied economist working the in the area of labour and health. The focus of my work is on the implications of externality and selection effects in health production, and I am particularly interested in how aspects of externalities and selection can interact with policy in intended or unintended ways. My work falls under three different themes: <a href="overview.html#ext">externalities and respiratory health</a>, <a href="overview.html#ecd">early childhood development</a>, and <a href="overview.html#pol">health policy and insurance</a>.</h4>

<h2><b><a name=ext>Externalities and respiratory health</a></b></h2>

<h4><b>Overview:</b> Health policy is often based on evidence estimating the effectiveness of health interventions; in some cases, this evidence is parsed by demographic factors that suggest different approaches to policy design by group status (e.g. age, location).  I am interested in what this evidence misses, and moreover, if these gaps have distributional implications.</h4>

This paper estimates the overall impact and externality effects of an influenza-vaccination program expanding coverage outside the typical target group. Using a triple-difference design, which exploits the introduction of a broad based vaccination program in Ontario and the quality of the vaccine from year to year, I link higher vaccination to health improvements. Results indicate: (i) coverage expansion leads to large excess gains for program regions; (ii) benefits exhibit decreasing returns corresponding to a standard model of disease dynamics; and (iii) substantial external benefits accrue to older adults.</h5>

<h5><b>Ward, Courtney J. forthcoming. "It's An Ill Wind: The Effects of Fine Particulate On Respiratory Hospitalizations," 
				<br/>
				<i>Canadian Journal of Economics.</i></b>				<br/>
				<br/>
While a growing literature in economics has established the harmful health effects of longstanding criteria pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, fine particulate pollution is relatively understudied. At the same time, the new Canada Wide Standards (CWS) and the recent EPA revisions have focused on this pollutant as a primary metric of air quality.  This paper provides evidence on the harmful effects of fine particulate pollution for Ontario, where municipalities enjoy fine particulate levels that are well below EPA standards and predominantly below CWS standards. Results provide strong evidence for the detrimental effect of fine particulate pollution on the respiratory health of children, with a one standard deviation change in particulate pollution, leading to a 4 percent increase in respiratory admissions. While these results inform the stringency of current pollution standards, they also highlight the importance of a global approach to air quality. For instance, the paper also shows that particulate levels in Ontario municipalities are strongly influenced by southerly winds from U.S. jurisdictions, which adhere to much more lenient EPA standards.</h5><h5><b>Ward, Courtney J. "Influenza, Vaccination and Externalities for Long Term Care Residents." 				<br/>
Work in progress.</b>				<br/>
				<br/>
Policy makers often rely on group-specific evidence from randomized control trials in designing vaccination campaigns and in gauging their expected impact. However, even where trials are informative of vaccine effectiveness by group, optimal policy design may run counter to this evidence depending on the nature of vaccine externalities. For instance, previous literature on the influenza vaccine and mortality finds high effectiveness for residents of long term care homes, suggesting this group for targeted policy. However, depending on the nature of externalities across group, this approach may yield low relative gains. This paper addresses this question by using hospital records over the last decade and focusing on the introduction of a broad based vaccination program in Ontario. I find evidence that vaccination in younger groups leads to large mortality gains for residents in long-term care homes, indicating that substantial external gains for this group are still possible even where vaccination rates are in the excess of 90 percent.</h5><h5><b>Hurley, Katrina, Ingrid Sketris, Paul Spin, Courtney J.

Work in progress. </b>				<br/>
				<br/>
When children with wheeze come to the IWK Emergency Department (ED) they are often given a medication known as salbutamol. Salbutamol relaxes the muscles in the breathing passages to make it easier to breath. Inhalation is the usual way to administer salbutamol because it allows it to work directly in the lungs.  There are two main ways to give salbutamol by inhalation: through a mask (nebulisation) or by a puffer (metered-dose inhaler) with a holding chamber. Prior to 2008, at the IWK ED, salbutamol was almost always given by mask. Since 2008, most patients are given salbutamol with a puffer and holding chamber. Research shows that this change reduces some side effects, makes the treatment more comfortable and gives more time for patients and families to practice using the medication properly. Most EDs are still using masks to give salbutamol. This study will evaluate the costs of both ways of giving salbutamol.</h5>

<h2><b><a name=ecd>Early childhood development</a></b></h2>

<h4><b>Overview:</b> The literature on early life influences is growing, with analysis focusing on detecting causal pathways from early exposures to later life outcomes. Within this literature, I extend my research on immunization by assessing the long-term impact of early school immunization mandates for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). I was motivated by the fact that, prior to school mandates, seasonal MMR epidemics occurred quite sharply in March-April. Moreover, this timing corresponded to well known birth-quarter differences in economic outcomes, which as Bound and Jaeger (2001) note, grew weaker in more recently born cohorts. Building beyond this work on immunization, I have started to consider more broadly: (1) differential effects by timing of early life exposures and (2) the implications of selection at birth.</h4>

				<br/>
In a well-known demonstration of the "fetal origins hypothesis," Almond (2006) showed that exposure to the 1918 influenza epidemic in the prenatal period had substantial and long lasting effects on income and educational attainment in adulthood. However, while the historical link for the prominent 1918 epidemic is clear, much less is known about the modern day implications of prenatal exposure to seasonal influenza epidemics. Moreover, these implications may be much broader in scope, possibly contributing to well-known seasonal differences in outcomes over birth quarter, and pointing to inequality in health and ability at the earliest stage of life. Using comprehensive data on influenza epidemics over the last two decades, this paper estimates the effect of prenatal exposure on birth outcomes, and tracks the impact on health and skill accumulation throughout early childhood.</h5>

<h5><b>Ward, Courtney J. 2013. "The Effects of Immunization Mandates: Does Prenatal Exposure to State School Immunization Policy Impact Later Economic Well-Being?" 
				<br/>
Under review.</b>				<br/>
				<br/>
State school immunization mandates of the late 1960s and 1970s had a substantial and immediate impact on measles, mumps and rubella incidence. While these mandates were targeted at the school age population, evidence implies benefits for children in-utero. Specifically, this paper shows that individuals whose prenatal period occurred after mandate adoption had much to gain from such policies. Using variability in the timing of immunization mandates across states and comparing individuals with prenatal periods before and after immunization laws were enacted, shows that adoption of school mandates had an immediate effect on birth weight and a long-term effect on adult health. This is after controlling for individual characteristics, state specific characteristics and flexible functions of the date of conception. Moreover, results are strongest for individuals whose gestational period covers the seasonal epidemic period for measles, mumps and rubella. Evidence of the contemporaneous and long term-effect of prenatal exposure to entry laws suggests that external benefits from mandatory immunization policies are much broader than accounted for in previous literature.</h5> 

<h5><b>Ward, Courtney J. 2013. "Fetal Health, Sex Ratios and Cigarette Policies." 
				<br/>
Under review.</b>				<br/>
				<br/>
Males are more vulnerable to maternal condition in utero, a fact that aligns with the long standing evolutionary theory that women in good condition are more likely to produce a male child (Trivers and Willard 1973). While the sex ratio is responsive to maternal characteristics like marital status, education and age (even in white U.S. mothers), the mechanisms by which these factors differentially affect male fetal health are still unclear. This paper adds to this literature by looking at a specific health behavior that has a well-documented effect on infant health: smoking. Using the universe of US birth files for 1989-2004 and anti-smoking polices exogenous sources of variation to fetal health, I look at the sex ratio of live births. Aside from signaling important differences in the underlying condition of the fetus, evidence of the sensitivity of the sex ratio is used to provide an estimate of the overall fetal loss associated with smoking behavior. Using this sensitivity I find that a doubling of cigarette taxes leads to a decrease of fetal loss on the order of 3 percent of the birth population. On the other hand, adoption of a workplace ban leads to an increase in fetal loss on the order of 11 percent of the birth population. </h5> 


<h5><b>Ward, Courtney J. "Willingness to Intervene by Gestational Age: Are Child Characteristics Important?" 
				<br/>
Work in progress.</b>				<br/>
				<br/>
The willingness to medically intervene is lower for babies with earlier gestational ages (Wilkinson, et al. 2009). Using the census of birth records for the last 3 decades in the U.S., I describe the factors most strongly associated with resuscitation across the gestational distribution, and, further, how survivorship across the gestational distribution has changed over time. The analysis provides four primary results. First, the survival rate for infants at earlier gestational ages has improved over this period. Second, there is a sharp discontinuous drop in the rate of assisted ventilation before 23 weeks gestation, which accords with clinical recommendations. Third, the APGAR score (a standard measure of health at birth) is negatively associated with assisted ventilation at the top of the distribution, but positively associated with assisted ventilation at the bottom, suggesting differences in the underlying willingness to intervene. Finally, after APGAR, the characteristic most strongly associated with the use of assisted ventilation by gestational age is whether the child is male. For instance, while there are no sex differences in the rate of assisted ventilation for babies born before 23 weeks or after 34 weeks, the rate for males is 17 percent higher in the case of 24-34 weeks, the zone where clinical guidelines on intervention are not absolute. This evidence, together, suggests that factors related to medical intervention at birth can lead to both differences in survivorship and differences in the characteristics of survivors.</h5>

This paper explores the pathway by which in utero exposure to disease translates into reduced human capital development. Using the data from the National Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP) and the timing of rubella epidemics each year, we identify the effect of rubella infection on later cognitive outcomes and physical health, and, importantly, highlight the differential impact on cognitive versus physical deficits based on timing of exposure. </h5>

While the cohort effects of in utero exposure to the 1918 influenza pandemic have been well documented (Almond 2006; Almond and Mazumder 2005), more recent work has questioned the interpretation of this evidence (Brown 2011). Specifically, Brown (2011) uses the 1920 and 1930 U.S. censuses to show that World War I triggered important differences in the type of men available for conception around the time of the epidemic. To shed light on these issues, we will use recently released census files from the Canadian Century Research Infrastructure project. In combining these census data over the last century, we will provide further insight into the sensitivity of results to differences in parental characteristics, exploiting, particularly, differences in military enrollment along linguistic lines (i.e. French and English), which occurred even in the face of conscription.</h5>

				<br/>
This paper uses variation created by the de-listing of insured services across Canadian provinces over the 1990s to estimate both the demand response across services, and whether this demand response varies by sub-groups such as low-income and elderly individuals. Our findings suggest that while the de-listing of services did affect utilization, the effect was not uniform across services, nor across populations. For example, while the demand for physiotherapy and eye exams decreased, the demand for speech therapy services, and chiropractic services increased in some cases. Nor did people adjust along all margins. While the number of people using any physiotherapy services decreased, the number of visits among those who did use physiotherapy services increased. We do not find large difference for low-income individuals with the exception of optometry services, nor do we find large differences between the elderly and the general population with the exception of physiotherapy.</h5>	

<h5><b>Ward, Courtney J. 2008. "Public Automobile Insurance, Social Pricing, and Traffic Collisions." 
				<br/>
Working Paper.</b>				<br/>
				<br/>
This paper analyses the relationship between motor vehicle collisions and social pricing within a public automobile insurance regime. Since social pricing does not adjust insurance premiums for social factors such as age, gender or marital status, it has implications for the risk distribution of insured drivers and consequences for the overall collision rate. Using the institution of social pricing in public automobile insurance in two Canadian provinces, this paper finds that total collisions are 22.2% higher under public insurance. It also finds that the institution of public insurance changes the number of actuarially riskier drivers insuring vehicles; specifically, younger or elderly drivers. For instance, drivers that are less than 25 years of age insure 4.6% more cars under social pricing relative to those aged 35 to 44. This result suggests a demand elasticity for those less than 25 of approximately 0.27.</h5>
